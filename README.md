# Breast-Tumor-Segmentation

## About the dataset:

Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of death among women worldwide. Breast Ultrasound Dataset is categorized into three classes  :  normal, benign, and malignant images. Breast ultrasound images can produce great results in classification, detection, and segmentation of breast cancer when combined with machine learning.
The number of patients is 600 female patients. The dataset consists of 780 images with an average image size of 500*500 pixels. The images are in PNG format. The ground truth images are presented with original images.

## Result of the model:
The results on Validation Data are way better than the results on Trainind Data on IoU, this may indicate that the model can perform way better than what it can do at the current point. The Loss is not Perfect it increases in the last but the model constructions are loooking perfect as this point.

Accuracy of the model = 0.98
Loss = 0.11
